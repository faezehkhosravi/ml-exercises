I tryed to show my capabilities in scientific programming and mathematical concepts necessary for the Master's program in Computer Vision & Data Science in this exercise.As you said, I used Python codes.
The provided Python code performs various tasks including:
Data Loading:Loading the "Wine Quality" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Data Preprocessing:Handling missing values by filling them with the mean and Creating a new feature by dividing 'fixed acidity' by 'volatile acidity'.
Exploratory Data Analysis:Visualizing the distribution of the new feature with a histogram and Displaying the correlation matrix.
Model Training:
   - Preparing data for modeling.
   - Splitting data into training and test sets.
   - Training a linear regression model.
   - Evaluating the model with Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Visualizing actual vs. predicted values.
Code Details:
 Data Loading:The dataset is loaded from a URL, and basic dataset information is displayed.
Data Preprocessing:Missing values are handled, and a new feature is created.
 Exploratory Data Analysis:The distribution and correlation matrix are visualized.
 Model Training:The data is prepared, split, and a linear regression model is trained and evaluated.
Requirements:
- Python 3.8
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
